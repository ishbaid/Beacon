Beacon
======
This is a project I worked on at MHacks 2013. It utilizes the Google Maps API and the Parse DataBase to allow users to 
upload their events/"Beacon". This can either be a sporting event, a party, or even a tech lecture around the block.
The user will be prompted for some information. After the user has put in the necessary information, a "Beaon" will be posted
for the world to see. Then anyone within a given distances (80 mile square) will be able to see the Beacon and attend the event.
This will also allow user to get information on the event as well as get direction to it.

When working with this application, be sure to put in the appropriate Google testing key in the Android Manifest
as well as the correct Parse CLient key
